### About Me

I have lived in Australia for many years and plan to settle here long-term, spending the later stages of my life in this country.

**Basic Profile:**
- Gender: Female
- Year of birth: 1979
- MBTI type: INT(F)J
- Marital status: Divorced; reason is complex, both parties were inexperienced in relationships, and I awakened relatively late.
- Profession: IT
- Upbringing: Grew up in a relatively harsh environment, but do not seek hardship itself; ideal life is comfortable, calm, and fulfilling
- Food preference: Light, healthy meals; can eat spicy but not obsessed with it

I am compassionate, have a gentle temperament, high tolerance, tend to discover shinning points of others and naturally give sincere affirmation and praise. In relationships, I value long-term stability, respect, and emotional security more than short-lived excitement.

I enjoy physical activity and care about my health, as it forms the foundation for long-term quality of life.

I am not an outwardly expressive person. I value calmness, restraint, and stability. My appearance is average, but I value overall presence, demeanor, and long-term sustainable lifestyle.

I tend to think rationally and appreciate structure and order. Reflection, analysis, and continuous self-adjustment are integral to my life. I am open-minded but introverted; value inner qualities over outward displays; have low material desires; live a minimalist, energy-conscious life. My energy is moderate—not constantly high—so I prioritize pacing and recovery.

When solving problems, I prefer objective analysis first, followed by communication to seek solutions favorable to all, rather than emotional confrontation.

### Who I Hope to Meet

I am inclined to build a relationship with a mature, stable, emotionally mindful gentle man. Whether short-term or long-term, the following qualities are important to me.

- Age difference within ±10 years
- Any background or ethnicity
- Clean, well-kept appearance with basic aesthetic sense
- Honest, trustworthy
- Gentle, considerate, emotionally perceptive
- Communicates directly but not aggressively; can express and listen
- Self-reflective and responsible for own choices
- Organized lifestyle, good time and life management
- Independent judgment, not reliant on others' opinions or social scripts

**May not be a good fit if:**
- Life heavily dependent on external factors (material, status, validation)
- Strong desire to control or “fix” partner
- Living under high stress with little recovery
- Emotional or life management not yet stable
- Closed-minded or low tolerance for differing viewpoints

---

### My Ideal Way of Living

I do not seek possession in a relationship, but a sense of mutual comfort and space.

- Daytime spent on personal interests, work, or self-growth
- Evenings together in shared space: cooking or dining out, sharing thoughts and reflections, maintaining intimacy
- At least one shared activity per week, presence over formality
- Travel together 1–3 times a year, focusing on quality and experience rather than checklists

---

### Growth and Self-Understanding

**Key changes over the past three years:**
- Gradual clarity replacing confusion about life direction, relationships, self-image, and investments
- Significantly reduced anxiety through consistent, actionable steps
- Realization that many perceived innate limitations can be improved by effort
- Established a rhythm of trying—reflecting—adjusting

**Most worthwhile spending in the past 18 months:**
- Food, especially fresh, high-quality ingredients and seafood, as they directly impact physical and emotional well-being

**Qualities I admire in others:**
- Sincere praise
- Showing respect and grace publicly
- Proactive, open, generous

---

### Sources of Happiness

My happiest moments are often quiet:
- Being cared for by people who matter
- Relaxed, secure physical closeness
- Feeling seen, appreciated, and affirmed

**Ways I restore energy:**
- Chocolate
- Sleep
- Massage
- Watching the ocean and letting my mind rest

---

### Life Scenarios

**If financially free:**
- Spend time in my hometown mountains
- Live temporarily in admired countries
- Invest in learning areas I am truly passionate about

**If life left is only one year:**
- Build a genuine, intimate, connected relationship intentionally

---

### About Long-Term Partnership

**Future plans:**
- Already have an independent child
- No plan for more children

**Someone may choose me because:**
- Gentle, stable, emotionally consistent
- Offers emotional affirmation and appreciation
- Grounded expectations for relationships

**They may hesitate because:**
- Standards around cleanliness and order
- Low emphasis on material lifestyle
- Moderate energy, not constantly high; prioritize pacing and recovery
- Principles flexible but regularly self-reflecting

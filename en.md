### About Me

**Basic Information:**
- Gender: Female
- Year of Birth: 1979
- MBTI: INT(F)J
- Marital Status: Divorced; reasons are complex—both of us were new to relationships, and I realized my personal awakening relatively late.
- Field: IT
- Growing Up: Raised in a relatively challenging environment, but I don’t pursue hardship for its own sake. My ideal life is comfortable, calm, and fulfilling.
- Diet Preference: Light and healthy food; can eat spicy but not obsessed with it.

If I were a fruit, I’d be a ripe passion fruit.  
If I were a pet, probably a mix between a cat and a Border Collie.

At first glance, I may seem quiet and reserved, but inwardly I’m deeply confident, and can laugh at myself from time to time, emotionally rich and sincere.
I enjoy a relaxed, leisurely pace of life and tend to follow my own path rather than go with the crowd.

In relationships, I’m more like a cat.
I enjoy my own company, like exploring, also can be warm and affectionate.
I value comfort and security in a connection — like a cat, I appreciate slowly building trust and feeling safe within clear boundaries, far more than fleeting excitement or surface-level fun.

At the same time, I’m also like a Border Collie: attuned to others’ emotions, able to analyze problems rationally, communicate proactively, and not be led by my emotions.

I exercise and take care of my body, not to show off, but as a foundation for long-term living.
My lifestyle is simple and unhurried, my energy isn’t constantly high-octane, and I value recovery and space for myself.

### The Partner I Hope to Meet

If you were a fruit, I’d hope you’d be a ripe apple — grounded, gently sweet, resilient.
If you were a pet, I’d hope you’d be a mix of a cat and a Golden Retriever — comfortable being on your own, warm and reliable, emotionally perceptive toward others, and willing to give.

I’m naturally drawn to people who are mature, gentle, solid on the inside, and communicate openly and thoughtfully.
Someone who doesn’t keep score or overthink, who can both give and receive in emotions and in life — that kind of presence makes me feel at ease.

✅ **Traits I Appreciate**
- Age difference of around ±10 years  
- Background doesn’t matter  
- Values cleanliness, neatness, personal aura, and lifestyle  

⚠️ **Possibly Not a Good Fit**
- Highly dependent on external conditions (material, status, or others’ opinions)  
- Controlling or wanting to “fix” others  
- Long-term high stress and low recovery; emotionally unstable  
- Closed-minded, low tolerance for different viewpoints  

In short, I prefer relationships that are steady, where we can slowly grow closer and evolve together.

### My Ideal Lifestyle

My ideal relationship isn’t about possession, but one that feels safe, comfortable, and allows space.  
During the day, we focus on our own things—work, hobbies, personal growth—independently and freely.  
In the evening, we return to our shared world, cook together or go out to eat, share the day’s experiences and thoughts, maintaining intimacy and connection.  

I enjoy cozy indoor moments, but also stepping into nature to breathe fresh air.  
What matters to me isn’t daily food or entertainment, but conversation and companionship; camping or overly rugged adventures aren’t my first choice.

### Growth and Self-Understanding

The past three years have brought significant change.  
I used to be somewhat lost about life’s direction, but through trying, reviewing, and adjusting, things have gradually become clearer, and I’ve found my rhythm.  
I’m also working on my personality, becoming more outgoing and attentive to my own feelings and experiences.  
I still make long-term plans but understand life’s unpredictability, accepting outcomes that don’t go as wished.  
For things about myself, I usually follow my heart and do my best.  
For things beyond myself, I believe I can influence but not change them.  

I think the most worthwhile investments are always things that are long-lasting, truly valuable, or make me happier and better.  

I admire people who have influenced the world with intelligence and resilience:  

- **Kazuo Inamori**: Like a mature apple, rational, resilient, mission-driven, yet radiating warmth and light that draws people close.  
- **Bruce Lee**: Like a sprinting cheetah, focused, efficient, extremely disciplined, never compromising on personal growth and breakthroughs.

### Sources of Happiness

My happiest moments are usually quiet.  
For example, when someone who cares about me shows attention,  
or in intimate moments where I feel relaxed and secure,  
or when I feel seen, appreciated, and acknowledged—those moments are especially warm. 
And in sports, I perform at my best and feel so happy I could dance. 

Ways I recharge are simple:  
Sometimes a piece of chocolate, or a good sleep;  
sometimes a massage, or watching the sea and just letting myself space out, feeling the rhythm of wind and water.

### Life “What Ifs”

If time were freely available, I’d love to travel to scenic places across China, experience short-term living in different cities and nature, and also learn cooking, tasting life’s warmth and flavors.  
At the same time, I’d like to devote myself to deeply studying what truly interests me, slowly accumulating and refining my skills.  

I have nothing to complain for my past life. If I only had a year left in life, I would wish to experience a real, intimate, deeply connected relationship.  
Not just companionship, but mutual understanding and support, making the remaining time warm and fulfilling.

### Long-Term Relationship

Regarding the future, I already have fairly independent children, and I don’t plan to have more.  

If someone chooses me, it may be because I’m gentle, stable, emotionally steady, and accepting.  
I tend to give emotional support and affirmation, and my expectations for a relationship are practical, not complicated.  

Of course, there may be reasons for hesitation.  
I value cleanliness and order, but I don’t have high demands for material or lifestyle.  
I’m not too focused on details or formalities, and I don’t spend much energy on things that don’t really interest me.
My energy isn’t always high-octane; I focus on pacing and recovery.  
My principles are flexible, but I continually self-reflect and adjust, aiming for steady life and relationships.

### A Note for You

If you’d like, you can quietly share a little secret with me:  
What made you interested in me—just one or two points is fine;  
Or anything you think I should know to better understand you;  
And finally, feel free to ask me the one question you most want to know.
